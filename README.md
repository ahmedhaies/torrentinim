Torrentinim is a self-hosted API-only, low memory footprint, torrent search engine.

# TODO: Take screenshots of some results.

### Goals

- **API-only**
- Crawl multiple index sites for torrents and magnet links.
- Easily integrates with both [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) and [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr).
- Run without ceremony. You download a binary, run it, that's it.
- Easy to understand source code. Special care is taken to keep code lean and understandable. No code golf here.
- High performance, extremely low memory footprint.

On average the application uses about 6MB of RAM:

We work closely with other providers and search engines to be respectful of their hardware and minimize our impact to their systems.

If you'd like us to add you to our supported vendors list, please drop us a Github Issue.

### Usage Guide

Torrentinim was designed to be painless to run. You download an executable, and run it. Done.
